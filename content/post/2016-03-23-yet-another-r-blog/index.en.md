So I finally started an R blog - not because I feel like I've got so much to really share, but because I enjoy reading the contributions from so many keen R bloggers, I hoped to be able to contribute some small thing to that world.

The specific catalyst was following [Dean Attali's](http://deanattali.com/) work, and the simplicity of implementing his [beautiful jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) theme. For any other lurkers out there, there is no excuse not to get something up and running (aside from time to actually write content of course... I set this up *five months* ago).

Of course a critical point for any blog is choosing a title. First let me say nothing can beat Richie Cotton's [4D Pie Charts](http://4dpiecharts.com/). Inscrutable errors refers to both the fact that I often make such things, and spend too long tryingt to figure out where they came from in my code, and the wonderfully inscrutable error messages from R. When I was learning R, I constantly came across `object of type 'closure' is not subsettable`. Being a neophyte who didn't know what type closure meant, and didn't know what subsetting was, my translation was 'You're an idiot. Stop it.'
