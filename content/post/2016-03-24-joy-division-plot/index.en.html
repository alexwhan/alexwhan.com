<p>A while ago I had had a great time answering <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33619980/spread-out-density-plots-with-ggplot/33620860#33620860">a question</a> on stackoverflow that was asking about recreating a plot from a <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-most-conservative-and-most-liberal-elite-law-schools/?ex_cid=538twitter">fivethirtyeight article</a> in ggplot2. You can see the original and my attempt below. I was satisfied with the style, but felt a bit dirty introducing a <code>for</code> loop.</p>

<p>Recreating other well known data visualisations is a reasonably common challenge for people who are into that sort of thing (see all the different recreations of Minard’s famous figure, some of them collected <a href="http://www.datavis.ca/gallery/re-minard.php">here</a>).</p>
<p>Working through the fivethirtyeight example above, I realised that it was a very similar approach to the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unknown_Pleasures">Joy Division album sleeve from Unknown Pleasures</a>, apparently from a visualisation of data from radio pulses, and quite possibly the most famous figure from a PhD thesis (<a href="http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/the-story-behind-joy-divisions-iconic-iunknown-pleasuresi-album-cover">more back story</a>).</p>
<p>Anyway, after a quick search I was really surprised that I couldn’t find anyone recreating this figure in ggplot2, so I thought I’d give it a go. In the end I think I spent the most time trying to generate data that approximately similar to the original, and I’m not entirely satisfied, so please let me know if you can do a better job!</p>
<p>Firstly to generate some data that somewhat reflects the original, which seems to be made up of multiple distributions + a whole lot of noise:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1234)

j1 &lt;- data.frame(Group = 1:50, 
                 n1 = sample(c(500, 1000, 2500, 5000), 50, TRUE, c(0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3)),
                 n2 = sample(c(200, 400, 500, 1000), 50, TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.15, 0.05)),
                 m1 = runif(50, -1, 1),
                 m2 = rnorm(50, 5, 0.5),
                 sd1 = sample(c(0.7, 1.5, 2.5), 50, TRUE, prob = c(0.15, 0.5, 0.35)),
                 sd2 = sample(c(0.7, 1, 3.5), 50, TRUE, prob = c(0.05, 0.6, 0.35)))
j2 &lt;- j1 %&gt;% 
  group_by(Group) %&gt;% 
  do(x = c(rnorm(.$n1, .$m1, .$sd1), rnorm(.$n2, .$m2, .$sd2))) %&gt;% 
  tidy(x)</code></pre>
<p>I’m fairly certain there would be neater ways to do this, if you’ve got a better idea, let me know…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>j3 &lt;- j2 %&gt;% 
  mutate(GroupNum = rev(as.numeric(Group))) %&gt;% 
  group_by(Group, GroupNum) %&gt;% 
  do(tidy(density(.$x, n = 100))) %&gt;% 
  group_by() %&gt;% 
  mutate(ymin = GroupNum * (max(y) / 10), #This constant controls how much overlap between groups there is
         ymax = y + ymin)

j4 &lt;- j3 %&gt;% 
  group_by(Group, GroupNum) %&gt;% 
  do(data.frame(approx(.$x, .$ymax, xout = seq(min(j3$x), max(j3$x), length.out = 250)))) %&gt;% 
  mutate(y = ifelse(is.na(y), j3$ymin[j3$Group == Group][1], y),
         ymin = j3$ymin[j3$Group == Group][1],
         ymaxN = y + rnorm(n(), 0.001, 0.005)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(x) %&gt;% 
  mutate(ymaxN = ifelse(row_number() %in% c(1, n()), ymin + min(ymaxN - ymin), ymaxN))

j4$ymaxS &lt;- smooth(j4$ymaxN, kind = &quot;S&quot;, endrule = &quot;copy&quot;, do.ends = FALSE)</code></pre>
<p>Again, I’m sure there are neater ways to do this, but I ended up doing my own density estimation to be able to use <code>geom_ribbon</code>, since the plot is essentially <code>geom_density</code> but removed from the x axis. As stated above, I really don’t feel comfortable with the <code>for</code>, but couldn’t figure a way to map to a grouping in this context.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- ggplot()
for (i in rev(unique(j4$GroupNum))) {
  p &lt;- p + geom_ribbon(data = j4[j4$GroupNum == i,], aes(x = x, ymin = ymin + min(j4$ymaxN - j4$ymin), ymax = ymaxS, group = GroupNum), colour = &quot;#F0F0F0&quot;, fill = &quot;black&quot;) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = j4$ymin[j4$GroupNum == i][1] + min(j4$ymaxN - j4$ymin), colour = &quot;#000000&quot;)
}
p &lt;- p + 
  coord_fixed(13) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;#000000&quot;),
          axis.text = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks = element_blank(),
          axis.title = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p>And the final result:</p>

<p>While I’m certainly not getting it <a href="http://ajournalofmusicalthings.com/an-epic-joy-division-tattoo/">tattooed on my back</a>, I’m reasonably satisfied with the end result.</p>
